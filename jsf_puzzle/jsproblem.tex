You walk into a room full of robots. Notes by a professor named J.S. litter the floor. Rumor has it he made a ground-breaking robot, but the robot's precious output was scrambled. The good professor had been puzzling over the output for some time, before the ... accident. You must finish his work and make sense of this output.
\begin{center}
\underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} \underline{\hspace{1cm}} 
\end{center}

You pick one of the notes up:

\begin{center}
    ``JS: F**k! Our robot's encoding algorithm is broken! If only there was some kind of regular pattern we could use to filter for
    the important stuff.''
\end{center}

You also notice strange expression on the wall:

\begin{center}
    \LARGE{[!()]+}
\end{center}

Additionally, you find a series of notes on the ground:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item JS: Entry 1: What used to be a normal web language ...
    \item JS: Entry 2: Don't look at individual symbols, if you look at it carefully, it looks like a familiar string ...
    \item JS: Entry 3: F**k! Almost there, the number of symbols seems to match up with ...
\end{enumerate}
